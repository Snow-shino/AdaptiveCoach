**Pro Tips**:
1. **Same conditions**: Test at same time of day, same gym, same equipment
2. **Don't peak**: This is a test, not a max-out session. Leave 1 rep in reserve on most tests.
3. **Video key tests**: Film pull-ups, jumps, climbs for form comparison
4. **Track trends**: One bad test doesn't mean failure. Look at 8-12 week trends.
5. **Celebrate small wins**: +1 pull-up or +5 seconds on a hang is REAL progress

---

**Remember**: The goal isn't perfection on every metric. The goal is consistent improvement across most metrics while staying injury-free. If you improve 60-70% of these tests, you're winning.
